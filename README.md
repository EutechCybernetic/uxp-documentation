# Releases

User Experience Portal (UXP) is a robust visualization tool crafted to innovate dashboard creation and customization. UXP equips developers with a wide list of reusable components and functionalities, enabling them to effortlessly construct dynamic widgets and visualizations in mere minutes.



{% hint style="info" %}
[UXP is rapidly evolving with numerous new features and enhancements being introduced daily. To streamline our development process, we are transitioning to proper versioning. We will discontinue updates to the old versions (master, dev, experimental) but will continue to provide support for these versions. We highly recommend using the compatible versions instead of the older ones. For users of the master version (and dev), please switch to the latest from version one (v1), and for those using experimental, please switch to the latest from version two (v2).]
